#Project 4
##frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio
---------------------------------------
Wanted to start by saying great project!
---------------------------------------
Please begin by knowing that I tried many variations
of builds to see what yeilded the best performace on
the entire project. I began with learning a bit about
gzip and compressing my own files. I tried multiple
compression algorithms also in succession to see how
much reduction I could squeeze from the images and code
without losing any visible quality. I tried to make as
many comments along the way in short to help with my
thought process. I have versions of all files in minified
and compressed versions. Some minified and compressed,
also was able to successfully build a gulp dependency
for tasking those things automaticlly. One thing I have
to be honest about, in Pizza's main.js I am notcompletely
satisfied with the way I have the second for loop setup.
I know although my page is performing well under 60FPS
there is more I could have done there. Im sure i'll look
back and it'll have been something simple but for now,
stumped am I.

! 1. Please begin with creating a simple server with python
        (!!! inside of the the frontend folder).
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080 <--- included for easy
copy and paste on terminal.

2. Next please create a tunnel with ngrok to serve also
port 8080 (!!! also inside of the the frontend folder).
ngrok 8080 <--for copy and paste on terminal. If you
dont have ngrok please download node and install npm
then ngrok.
	2-0 Install of node.js https://nodejs.org/download/
	2-1 Install of npm https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install
	2-2 Install of ngrok https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok

3. Now you will be able to serve the project on a local
tunnel. This is how my version of the site can be tested.
Please contact me via email/twitter if youhave any
question/probelms.
