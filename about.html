Since then, I have worked as a freelancer and with small agile teams.

While I write mostly Javascript at work currently, I’m excited to spend time learning various new languages. On my own time, I’ve recently worked with Yeoman, Angular and MongoDB (a little with relation to front-end data). Because I love learning new technologies, I tend to pick them up fairly quickly. I’d prefer to stay in Austin (or work remotely), but would be interested to learn more about offers in other places as well.</div></div></div></div></md-content>
