           BUGGER
           ======

This is a spin on the classic game of Frogger, hope you enjoy.
I had tried to make it as difficult as it was for me to build out
this game. All-in-all, very greatful to all the Udacity coach's,
and mentors for developing such a great project. With out this I
feel as though I might have never wrapped my head around scope,
closure, and prototype's. With that said, this is my game.

The purpose of my version is...
===============================

*- By using your "up,right,down,left" arrow key's to move about the game.

* - The goal is to get across to the water and/or pick up as many gem's as
    possible with in 60 second's. Both have different score value so choose
    wisely.

* - If you can get at least 110 points(with-in 60sec's) and not have lost any live's,
    your in for a nostalgic phrase!

* - Avoid getting bit by bugs, if at all possible not even once!


Other than that please have fun, and of course I'm open to any and all
suggestions. github - @alphapilgrim
